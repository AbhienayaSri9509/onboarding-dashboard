The project is a React-based frontend interface designed to simulate a real-world SaaS onboarding flow followed by a personalized dashboard. It guides new users through a multi-step registration process and then displays a custom dashboard tailored to their submitted preferences.

Think of platforms like Notion, Slack, or Trello — when a user signs up, they often go through onboarding steps. This project emulates that flow, preparing the ground for real-world apps that involve:

User account setup

Business data collection

Preference configuration

A home dashboard showing personalized metrics

Purpose:

Improve the user experience during the onboarding process.

Offer a modular UI suitable for SaaS, CRM, or Admin panels.

Serve as a starter template for production-ready React apps.

Ideal For:

Developers learning React, Tailwind CSS, and React Context.

Teams prototyping SaaS dashboards or admin portals.

Students building frontend capstone projects.
